# User Stories - AI CodeLens

## 1. Authentication & Identity
- **Sign Up**: As a new user, I want to create an account using my email and password so that I can access the app's features securely.
- **Login**: As a returning user, I want to log in with my credentials so that I can access my saved preferences and credits.
- **Logout**: As a user, I want to log out of my session to protect my account on shared devices.
- **Session Persistence**: As a user, I want my login session to be remembered so I don't have to log in every time I refresh the page.

## 2. Code Analysis (The "Architect")
- **Input Code**: As a developer, I want to paste my code into an editor with syntax highlighting so I can review it comfortably.
- **Set Objectives**: As a developer, I want to specify what my code *should* do (e.g., "Sort by price") so the AI can check if I met my goal.
- **Get Review**: As a developer, I want to receive a professional audit covering Security, Performance, and Best Practices.
- **Receive Fixes**: As a developer, if my code is broken or inefficient, I want the AI to provide a corrected version ("Proposed Solution") that I can copy or apply directly.

## 3. Usage & Credits
- **View Credits**: As a free user, I want to see how many analysis credits I have left so I can manage my usage.
- **Premium Access**: As a power user, I want to have "Unlimited" status so I can analyze code without restriction.
- **Paywall**: As a free user who runs out of credits, I want to be informed via a modal so I know why I can't proceed.

## 4. Mobile Experience
- **Responsive Layout**: As a mobile user, I want the interface to adapt (stacking the editor and insights) so I can use the app on my phone.
- **Touch Controls**: As a mobile user, I want buttons and inputs to be easily tappable.
